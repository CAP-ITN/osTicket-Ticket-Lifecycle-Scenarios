The end-user (Billy.Ray) submits a critical ticket reporting that the entire mobile and online banking system is down. Help Desk Agent Rick reviews the ticket, noting that priority, department, SLA, and assignment are initially unassigned. Rick updates the ticket to Sev-A priority (1-hour response, 24/7 support), assigns it to the Online Banking Department as he does not have permissions for this critical outage.

After investigating the issue, (Online Banking Department) Bob determined that a recent update to the banking system caused the outage. To resolve the issue, Bob rolled back the update, which immediately restored online and mobile banking services. The software vendor was notified about the faulty update, and with systems back to normal, the incident was marked as resolved, ensuring uninterrupted service for customers.
